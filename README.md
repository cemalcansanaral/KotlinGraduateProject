<h1 align="center">Graduate Project (<a href = "techcareer.net">Techcareer.net</a> Android Bootcamp)</h1>

As a bootcamp graduation project, I created a food ordering application with the application name MyDesire.

* The data is obtained from web services on the Internet.

## Technologies I use in the application:

* MVVM
* Databinding
* Navigation Component
* Retrofit

## Here's what the app can do:

* Listing the Meals
* Meal Detail Screen
* Ability to Select Pieces in Detail
* Adding the Meal with the Selected Quantity to the Basket
* Viewing the Meals in the Basket
* Deleting Food from the Basket
